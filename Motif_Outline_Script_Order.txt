Motif Discovery Pipeline:

Get FASTA(assembly) and GFF (annotation) files for each species

Modify FASTA/GFF files as needed	
	1. Make Genic GFF
		Bash script: Make_GFF_genic.bash
			#This will convert all full GFFs to genic GFFs within Paramecium_GFF directory... will loop through directory
			#excute in directory with GFFs
		Bash script: Make_genic_GFF_proteinID.txt
			#This will change all GeneIDs to ProteinIDs 
			#copy and paste each command to make sure there are no issues
	2. Make Intergenic GFF
		R script: Make_Intergenic_GFF_new.R
			#This will use a genic GFF to create an intergenic GFF
	3. Make Intergenic FASTA
		R script: Make_intergenic_FASTA.R
			#This will take both a FASTA file and intergenic GFF and output an intergenic FASTA
			#Intergenic FASTA will only contain sequences between annotated genes
				#Lengths range from 1 to a few thousand nts

Run MEME on Gene Families
	1. Make FASTA files of gene families
		R script: Get_Upstream_All_Aurelias.R
			#This will take all FASTA and full GFFs for all 14 spp as well as a POFF table of para-orthologs
			#It will go line by line in the table, extracting the upstream sequence for each gene and putting them into a single file
				#16,587 lines in POFF table -> 16,587 FASTA files
	2. Run MEME on gene families
		Python script: meme_auto_query.py
			#This will submit MEME jobs through a bash interface
				#Python meme_auto_query.py
			#MEME output files will go into a specified directory

Parse MEME Output
	1. Extract all info from xml file
		R script: GetAllMEMEInfo.R
			#set wantPWM=F
	2. Create directory of PWMs
		R script: GetAllMEMEInfo.R
			#set wantPWM=T
		
Get Genomic Location of Motif
	1. Scan PWM against genome
		R script: getPWM_Scores_Paramecium.R
			#This script requires another script given to me by Jeff
				#C++ script: getPWM_Scores.cpp
			#This will go position by position across a scaffold and return a score based on the MEME scoring matrix
